# ST_Ol_rhizome
These scripts were used to process the spatial expression matrix of 2 Oryza longistaminata datasets.

The first datasets are 3 developmental stages of rhizomes, scripts used for this datasets were reposite in ST_Ol_rhizome/diff_stages/

The second datasets are tillers and rhizomes, scripts used for this datasets were reposite in ST_Ol_rhizome/tiller_and_rhizome/

We subseted the first datasets using ST_Ol_rhizome/diff_stages_sub/subset.ipynb to get the rhizome initiation regions.
